# Pythonista
My experiences with programming for iOS in Pythonista.

## THE NPK Weather App
A little utility to check the weather forecast for the next few days. This 
version is custom made for iPhone, so it uses Pythonista 3. It makes use of 
the web API provided by openweathermap.org and requires 'arrow' (which you can
install with pip using StaSh).

It shows the current weather and the forecast for the next 5 days.

It can be customized for dark mode, by changing a simple variable in the first section of the code.
